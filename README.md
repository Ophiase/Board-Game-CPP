## Architecture

This project has an MVC architecture.

- #### Model :
    - Each game have its own implementation of GameState class, Action class
        - a GameState is composed of :
            - a BoardType (inherits Board class)
            - a list of scores
            - its step
            - current player id.
        - ActionType :
            - It requires to implement the following methods
                - ``getActions`` : Get all the actions appliable on a given GameState.
                    - Checkers queen can have a gigantic number of possible actions, so we restrict the actions given for capture
                - ``hasRemainingActions`` : is there any action left ?
                - ``isValid`` : Can the action be applied on a GameState ?
                - ``apply`` : Apply the action onto a GameState.
                - ``actionEquivalence`` : Do the two actions have the same effect over a given GameState?
                
- #### View :
    - The launcher alternates between Menu and Games
        - If Menu.focus is empty, it focuses the Menu
        - If Menu.focus is non empty, it focuses the corresponding Game 
    - Each game have its own implementation of the Game class
        - a Game class is a view for a specific game.
- #### Controller :
    - Each game have its own implementation of Manager class
    - Manager acts as the controller :
        - it initializes the first game state, and it checks if an action is valid before applying it 

## Future Development

- GUI
    - helper for Checkers
    - arrows for Checkers
- BOT
    - MonteCarloStrategy
